      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <p class="community">The leftover plums from the local farmer’s market would have been tossed, 
          but <u>afoodable</u> helped us reach out to the farmer’s market. They 
          generously donated the plums to the boys’ U12 junior soccer team. The plums 
          arrived securely packaged with only some cosmetic imperfections, and were a 
          sweet half-time treat! We won a delicous 3-0 victory! </p>
